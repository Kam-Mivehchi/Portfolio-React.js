                    Proven research professional with experience in the development of cleaning chemicals and semiconductor growth. As an R&D Analytical Chemist for Shepard Bros Inc, I optimized several quality control processes to improve accuracy and precision of titrations substantially. Additionally, I lead efforts to resolve customers cleaning issues by developing 2 new products. In this role, I quickly adapted to the industry and was formulating new products within 6 months.
